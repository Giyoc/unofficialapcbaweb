            <h2><b>WHAT IS HUMSS?</b></h2>
                <h2><i>Humanities and Social Sciences is a strand offered to senior high school students under the Academics track. The HUMSS Senior High School strand is designed for students who intend to take up journalism, communication arts, liberal arts, education, and other social-science related courses in college. Because these courses revolve heavily around interacting with other people, the Senior High School HUMSS strand is all about improving students’ reading, writing, and speaking skills.</i></h2>
                <p>A common misconception about the Senior High School HUMSS strand is that it is a lot easier than other tracks and strands or that students who take this strand do not need to study as hard as compared to the other strands (especially those in the Academic track). While HUMSS does not involve as much Math and computation as tracks like ABM or STEM, it is by no means “easier.”</p>
    
                <p>HUMSS is heavily-centered on research and will require students to read, write, and present multiple papers throughout senior high school. Students under this strand will be exposed to eye-opening subjects such as world religions, Philippine and world literature, political and community development specialization subjects, and more.</p>
