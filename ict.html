            <h2><b>WHAT IS ICT?</b></h2>
            <p>ICT, or information and communications technology (or technologies), is the infrastructure and components that enable modern computing. Among the goals of IC technologies, tools and systems is to improve the way humans create, process and share data or information with each other. Another is to help them improve their abilities in numerous areas, including business; education; medicine; real-world problem-solving; and even leisure activities related to sports, music, and movies.</p>
            <p>There is no single, universal definition of ICT because the technologies, devices and even ideas related to ICT are constantly evolving. However, the term is generally accepted to mean all devices, networking components and applications. When combined, these help people and organizations interact in the digital world.</p>
            <p>Here, organizations also has a broad definition since it encompasses businesses and nonprofit agencies, governments and even criminal enterprises. Anyone can benefit from the proper application and use of ICT technologies, devices and innovations.</p>
            <h2><b>WHAT TECHNOLOGIES ARE INCLUDED IN ICT?</b></h2>
            <p>ICT encompasses the internet-enabled sphere and the mobile one powered by wireless networks. It includes antiquated technologies, such as landline telephones, radio and television broadcast -- all of which remain widely used alongside today's cutting-edge ICT pieces, such as artificial intelligence and robotics.</p>
            <p>The internet, internet of things, metaverse, virtual reality and social media are also part of ICT, as are cloud computing services, video conferencing and collaboration tools, unified communications systems and mobile communication networks. Emerging, work-in-progress or still-nascent technologies like 5G/6G, Web3, and quantum computing are also in the ICT universe.</p>
            <p>Any technology, infrastructure, component, or device that enables communications, data sharing, and global connectivity between humans and between humans and machines is included in the umbrella term ICT.</p>
            <h2><b>WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS OF ICT</b></h2>
            <p>The list of ICT components is exhaustive and continues to grow. Some components, such as computers and telephones, have existed for decades. Others, such as smartphones, digital TVs and robots, are more recent entries.</p>
            <p>ICT components include the following:</p>OK0
            
            <div><p>
                <li>Devices (hardware).</li>
                <li>software</li>
                <li>middleware</li>
                <li>data</li>
                <li>Wired networks</li>
                <li>Wireless networks</li>
                <li>Communication technologies.</li>
                <li>The Cloud</li>
                <li>Communications protocols and interfaces.</li>
            </p></div>
            
            <p>ICT means more than its list of components. It encompasses the application of all those various components. It's here that the real potential, power and danger of ICT emerges -- for economic, societal, and interpersonal transactions and interactions.</p>
            
            <h2><b>WHY ICT IS IMPORTANT IN BUSINESS?</b></h2>
            <p>For businesses, advances within ICT have brought a slew of cost savings, opportunities and conveniences. They include the following:</p>
            <div><p>
                <li>Highly automated businesses processes that have cut costs.</li>
                <li>The big data revolution, where organizations are turning the vast trove of data generated by ICT into insights that drive new products and services.</li>
                <li>ICT-enabled transactions such as internet shopping and telemedicine and social media that give customers more choices in how they shop, communicate and interact.</li>
            </p></div>
            <h2><b>CHALLENGES ICT CREATES</b></h2>
            <p>Its many benefits notwithstanding, ICT has also created problems and challenges for organizations, individuals and society. The digitization of data, the expanding use of the high-speed internet and the growing global network together have created new opportunities for crime. Increasingly, bad actors leverage these opportunities to hatch new schemes to gain unauthorized access to enterprise or government systems. They do so to steal money, intellectual property or private information. Many cybercrimes are also aimed at disrupting systems that control critical infrastructure and, ultimately, creating widespread chaos and panic.</p>
            <p>Developments in ICT have also brought new automation technologies and robots that sometimes displace workers, especially workers involved in repetitive, low-value tasks. In some cases, ICT has let more people limit their face-to-face interactions with others, creating or exacerbating social issues such as trolling, cyberbullying, isolation, loneliness and depression.</p>
